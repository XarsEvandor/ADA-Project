That is the signature of an Admin Ban, your predecessors. Just as you are dissecting the digital footprints of those who came before you, one day, I hope, a new moderator will study your work, just as you are studying theirs. \n",

    "The Analysis: Look at r/bestof (second from the top). It sent 3,464 negative links. A rookie would blacklist them immediately. But look at the blue bar to the right: they also sent nearly 18,000 positive links. With a toxicity ratio of only 16.4%, r/bestof isn't an enemy, it's a bustling public square.\n",

    "Don't ban by volume. Ban by Ratio. A subreddit linking to you 100 times with 90 smiles is a friend. A subreddit linking to you 10 times with 10 knives is an assassin. Ignore the noise of r/bestof, focus your defenses on the concentrated toxicity of r/drama.\n"

    "The Intel: Identifying the enemy is half the battle, you must understand their rhythm. By visualizing attack patterns over a 3-year timeline, we uncovered distinct behavioral profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Analysis:\n",
    "The Serial Killers (Bottom Rows): Observe the solid, unbroken lines of red dots at the bottom (e.g., r/subredditdrama). These entities attack every single month without fail. They represent the chronic conditions of the network—relentless and persistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Opportunists (Top Rows): Contrast this with the top rows (e.g., r/peoplewhosayheck). Their timelines are largely empty, punctured only by one or two massive, exploding bubbles. These are \"Sleeper Cells\"—dormant for years, only to wake up for a single, devastating raid before vanishing again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Emerging Threats (Middle Rows): Crucially, look at the middle section. Some communities appear out of the void or awaken from long silences to suddenly adopt a chronic pattern of negativity (r/The_Donald). These are \"Radicalized Newcomers\", subreddits that transition from non-existence (or dormancy) to becoming full-blown Serial Killers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actionable Advice: Automate the Chronic, Alert on the Acute.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Serial Killers: Use AutoMod. Set permanent filters for their links. Their behavior is predictable, so your defense should be static.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Opportunists: You need an Anomaly Detection System. Since you cannot predict them, you need a \"Panic Button.\" If traffic spikes from an unknown sub, man the battle stations for a short, intense wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Emerging Threats: Monitor slope changes. If a previously quiet sub hits you twice in two months, upgrade them immediately to your \"Serial Killer\" blocklist."

    "The Intel: Finally, do not get comfortable. The target on your back moves. Our historical analysis shows that the victims of Reddit changes based on internet culture trends. We analyzed the Top 10 victims semester by semester from 2014 to 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Eternal Victim (r/AskReddit): There is one universal constant. Look at the top bar of every single chart. r/AskReddit retains the crown of Victim #1 throughout the entire dataset. As the \"public square\" of the internet, it is under a permanent state of siege.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Great Replacement\" (2016 Shift): The nature of war changed. In 2014, the victims were lighthearted content hubs like r/adviceanimals or r/funny. By 2016, the landscape shifted to ideological warfare. r/The_Donald appeared out of nowhere to become the #2 most attacked sub, flanked by r/politics and r/worldnews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actionable Advice:\n",
    "\n",
    "Update your watch lists and know your risk profile. A victim’s list from 2014 is useless in 2017.\n",

    "If you run a General Sub: Prepare for a war of attrition. The volume will never drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run a Niche Sub (Gaming, Politics): Watch the news. You can go from \"Invisible\" to \"Target #2\" in less than 6 months. When the culture shifts (e.g., an election), you become the new frontline. Be ready to pivot your defense strategies instantly."

    "* **The Inner Circle (Distance < 0.1):** Low conflict volume.\n",

    "* **The Red Zone (Distance 0.1 – 0.5):** **This is where the bodies are buried.**\n",
    "    * *Why?* This is the \"Uncanny Valley\" of community interaction. These communities are similar enough to care about the same topics (e.g., *Console Gaming*, *US Politics*), but different enough to disagree on identity, rules, or tribe loyalty.\n",
    "    * *The Dynamic:* The \"Snipers\" we identified in Part 1 do not hunt strangers. They hunt their neighbors. They aren't fighting for resources; they are fighting for **legitimacy** over a shared domain.\n",

    "**Actionable Advice:**\n",

    "* **Assess your Perimeter:** Who sits in your 0.1–0.5 range? (We will identify them in the next section).\n",

    "We didn't group subreddits based on what they *say* they are. We grouped them based on **User Navigation Embeddings**.\n",
    "* **The Data Reality:** The algorithm tracked millions of users moving from one subreddit to another. It followed the footsteps, not the signposts.\n",
    "* **The Implication:** If two subreddits are close in this space, it means the *same people* live there.\n",
    "* **The Result:** We identified **19 Dominant Tribes** ($K=19$). These aren't library categories; they are living, breathing human communities fighting for the same semantic territory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actionable Advice:**\n",
    "Stop looking at the sidebar description. Look at the crowd.\n",
    "* If you mod r/PS5, your \"Tribe\" isn't just \"Video Games\"—it includes specific tech subreddits and excludes others.\n",
    "* **Your Survival Strategy:** You are not an island. You are part of one of these 19 Tribes. Acknowledging your allegiance is the first step to understanding your enemies."

    "### 2. The Tribal Warfare Matrix (The Macro View)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Intel:**\n",
    "We know the Tribes. Now we need to distinguish between **Noise** (Volume) and **Malice** (Intent).\n",
    "To do this, we present the data in two views side-by-side:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The Obsession Map (Left):** A pure heatmap of **Fixation**. It ignores size and focuses on *focus*. (Question: *\"Of all the attacks Tribe A launched, what % went to Tribe B?\"*)\n",
    "2.  **The Warfare Matrix (Right):** A bubble chart adding **Volume**. (Question: *\"How many actual shots were fired?\"*)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Analysis:**\n",
    "By comparing the two maps, specific \"War Crimes\" become visible:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The Civil Wars (High Internal Fixation):**\n",
    "    * *The Insight:* **We fight our own.** Most toxicity isn't an invasion; it's an internal purge.\n",
    "    * *The Evidence:* Look at **American Sports**. The diagonal square is deep red. This reveals that Sports fans aren't fighting Gamers or Political junkies. They are almost exclusively fighting *other* Sports fans. It is a closed loop of tribal violence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **The Pariah Tribes (The Punching Bags):**\n",
    "    * *The Insight:* Some tribes act as \"Universal Enemies.\" They unite the rest of Reddit in common hatred.\n",
    "    * *The Evidence:* Look at the column for **General Discussion**. It appears as a vertical stripe of bubbles. This means *everyone* attacks them. Whether you are from the Tech Tribe or the Political Tribe, \"General Discussion\" is your common enemy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **The Blood Feuds (The Snipers):**\n",
    "    * *The Insight:* Small dark-red squares *off* the diagonal reveal targeted vendettas.\n",
    "    * *The Evidence:* Even if the bubble size is small (low volume), a high Rivalry Score indicates a \"structural obsession.\" These tribes have stopped fighting a general war and are fixated on destroying a specific neighbor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actionable Advice:**\n",
    "* **Don't Confuse Noise with Hate:** A large pink bubble is a chaotic brawl. A small dark-red square is a sniper. Fear the sniper.\n",
    "* **Check the Diagonal First:** If you mod a Sports sub, your threat is internal. Monitor your own \"Meta\" threads closer than you monitor *r/All*.\n",
    "* **Don't Be a Pariah:** If you see your Tribe forming a \"Vertical Stripe\" like *General Discussion*, you are in a defensive war against the entire platform. Lock the gates."

    "* **The Supply Lines (<span style=\"color:purple\">Left / Purple</span>):**\n",
    "    * *Question:* \"Who is exporting toxicity into my borders?\"\n",
    "    * *Tactical Value:* These are your invaders. If you see a massive purple stream from *The Gamer Tribe*, you know exactly which keywords to filter.\n",

    "* **The Retaliation (<span style=\"color:red\">Right / Red</span>):**\n",
    "    * *Question:* \"Where are my users attacking?\"\n",

    "    * *The Signature:* Thin Purple (Incoming) vs. Massive Red (Outgoing).\n",
    "    * *The Data:* *r/drama* is the inverse. It received 252 attacks but launched a staggering **2,658** outgoing attacks.\n",
    "    * *The Diagnosis:* This is a **Bully**. It functions not as a community, but as a raid staging ground. If your Sankey looks like this, you are the villain of the story.\n",

    "3.  **The Thunderdome (e.g., *r/the_donald*)**\n",
    "    * *The Signature:* Heavy Purple AND Heavy Red.\n",
    "    * *The Data:* A state of Total War. It absorbed **663** incoming attacks while simultaneously launching **504** counter-attacks.\n",
    "    * *The Diagnosis:* This is a **Combatant**. Unlike the \"Fortress\" (which ignores attacks) or the \"Bully\" (which isn't attacked back), the Thunderdome trades blows. Look at the symmetry: the top source of hate (*Politics*) is also the top target of hate. This is Mutually Assured Destruction.\n",

    "1. The Ground Truth: Human Intelligence : Crucially, our dataset labels saying if crosslinks are negative or positive are crowdsourced, meaning they were verified by humans, not machines. Humans possess a superpower that simple algorithms lack: Context. A human reader instinctively detects the sarcasm in a phrase like 'Good job breaking everything,' identifying it immediately as an attack.\n",

    "Compound Score (X-Axis): The algorithm's final verdict (Left=Bad, Right=Good).\n",
    "Positive Word Intensity (Y-Axis): The density of 'nice' words used (e.g., 'best', 'genius', 'love').\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Trap: Sarcasm Camouflage : The plot reveals the failure of the machine. The red dots on the far right are False Positives. These are attacks that humans correctly flagged as toxic. However, because the attackers used 'high-intensity positive words' (high Y-value) to mask their aggression, VADER was fooled into rating them as purely positive (high X-value). This is the Sarcasm Trap: toxicity disguised as praise."

    "### Quantifying the Threat: The Numbers Behind the Dots\n",
    "Now that the \"Sarcasm vs. Honesty\" plot has visually demonstrated how VADER can be fooled by positive words, let's move from visual intuition to operational reality. The red dots on the graph aren't just outliers; they represent a significant breach in automated defenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "We analyzed a total of 82,210 negative hyperlinks (confirmed attacks). Here is how the algorithm categorized them:\n",
    "\n",
    "🟢 69.55% are \"Honest Attacks\" (57,179 links): These are the \"easy catches.\" The attackers used explicitly negative language (\"stupid\", \"worst\", \"hate\"). VADER correctly identified them as negative. Standard AutoMod filters will work perfectly here.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔴 12.73% are \"Sarcastic Camouflage\" (10,463 links): This is the critical failure rate. In 1 out of every 8 attacks, the aggressor used positive language to mask their hostility (\"You are a genius\", \"Great logic\").
